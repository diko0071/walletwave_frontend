## Funny thing
Just kind notice that 99.9% of this code was written by AI. I do know how to write backend, but it was the first time I've touched frontend. I'm not joking, when I started I didn't even know what `const` stands for.

But I think as a MVP it looks good. I mean the visualization, the tables and the chat are all good. Thanks [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for ready-made components, [vercel v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) for AI generated component, and of course [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/) for the magic.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or

# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
